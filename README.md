# triage-server-v2

Heyoo.

Basically there's just `server.js` and `mongo.js` for our code.

This is its own thing on glitch because I don't like serving the web assets from the same server.

Also if I didn't serve the web assets from the same server then I wouldn't have an excuse to use the `cors` middleware.

Um, yeah this code should be pretty straight forward because this API is just middleware between the client and the MongoDB database lol.
